# Decision Log

Append-only log of methodology, scope, and architectural decisions for
this project. One H2 per decision, newest at the bottom (chronological
order makes it easier to follow how thinking evolved).

Each entry should answer:
- **Context** — what triggered the decision; what was unclear or
  contested.
- **Decision** — what we chose, in one or two sentences.
- **Rationale** — why this option over alternatives we considered.
- **Revisit when** — what new evidence would re-open the question.

If a later decision overrides an earlier one, *don't* edit the old
entry — write a new one and reference the prior by date and title.

Pure API facts and platform constraints belong in
`pjm-api-constraints.md`, not here.

## 2026-05-10 — Adopt decision-log + superpowers conventions

**Context.** Project is just starting. Methodology decisions are
already accumulating (data scope, pivots from the proposal) and
they'll be invisible to future sessions unless captured.

**Decision.** Two conventions:
1. Record every methodology, scope, or architectural decision in this
   file at the moment it's made.
2. Use Claude superpowers skills as the default workflow:
   `brainstorming` before any creative/feature work, `writing-plans`
   for multi-step implementation, `test-driven-development` for code,
   `systematic-debugging` for bugs, `verification-before-completion`
   before claiming work done.

**Rationale.** Research projects accumulate undocumented "we decided
X because Y" choices that quietly drive later code. Writing them down
once is much cheaper than re-deriving them mid-analysis. The
superpowers skills exist to enforce planning discipline that this
project's CLAUDE.md already asks for.

**Revisit when.** If the decision log gets noisy with low-stakes
entries (e.g. library choices that nobody contests), tighten the
threshold for what warrants an entry.

## 2026-05-10 — Cap nodal 5-min LMP scope to the Standard window

**Context.** PJM Data Miner 2 archives the 5-min RT LMP feed after
186 days. Archived queries cannot filter by `pnode_id` and must stay
within a single calendar year. Pulling the full feed for our 3
target substations across 2020–2025 would require downloading every
PJM pnode's 5-min LMP for each calendar year — likely terabytes —
purely to filter client-side. See `pjm-api-constraints.md` §
"Archived (Historic) data".

**Decision.** Three-tier scope:
- **5-min nodal LMP:** restricted to the Standard window (last
  ~6 months from the date of pull). Used for the high-resolution
  phase-transition analysis.
- **Hourly nodal LMP** (`rt_hrl_lmps`, `da_hrl_lmps`): pulled for the
  Standard window (last ~2 years, currently mid-2024 onward) for
  long-window nodal congestion trends.
- **Older periods (pre-2024):** zonal aggregates only (DOM zone),
  losing nodal granularity. Used as historical context, not as the
  primary signal.

**Rationale.** The proposal's 2020–2025 nodal 5-min ambition is not
operationally feasible through Data Miner 2 without a bulk research
extract. Rather than block on that, ship analysis on what's queryable
and treat older nodal data as an open follow-up (option (c) below).

**Open follow-up.** Email PJM Data Miner support to ask whether a
research-grade bulk historical extract for `rt_fivemin_hrl_lmps`
exists outside the Data Miner 2 API.

**Revisit when.** A bulk extract becomes available, OR we get a
clean-enough signal in the 6-month/2-year windows that historical
nodal data isn't needed.

## 2026-05-10 — Use hourly DOM-zone load for the volatility metric

**Context.** The proposal's mechanism is "data-center-driven minute-
scale load swings push the LMP into a heavy-tailed regime." The 5-min
load feed (`inst_load`) only exposes load at the *region* level (PJM
SOUTHERN REGION etc.), bundling DOM with DAY/EKPC/etc. DOM-specific
load is hourly only.

**Decision.** Compute the load-volatility metric on **hourly
`hrl_load_metered` for the DOM zone**, accepting the resolution
mismatch with the 5-min LMP feed.

**Rationale.** Region-level 5-min load dilutes the data-center
signal across a much wider geographic and economic footprint than
DOM alone, which arguably hurts the analysis more than coarser
resolution does. Hourly DOM is also more directly interpretable as
"DOM-zone aggregate behavior" and aligns with the hourly LMP feed
used for the long-window analysis.

**Revisit when.** If the hourly load → LMP-regime relationship is too
weak to detect, consider augmenting with `inst_load` regional 5-min
as a secondary signal (variance ratio between region and DOM, etc.).

## 2026-05-10 — Pull all matching pnodes for the three target substations

**Context.** The proposal names three substations: Pleasant View,
Ashburn, Goose Creek. PJM's pnode reference (`pnode` feed) typically
returns multiple buses per substation — different voltages, EHV vs.
LOAD subtypes, generator vs. load-side metering points.

**Decision.** Initial pull: every `pnode` row in `zone=DOM` whose
`pnode_name` partial-matches one of the three substation names,
regardless of `pnode_subtype` or `voltage_level`. Filter / narrow
later based on what the actual congestion signal looks like.

**Rationale.** Cheaper to pull broad and prune than to pull narrow
and re-pull. Voltage/subtype distinctions matter for interpretation
but not for initial signal detection. The `pnode` feed is small and
this metadata pull is one-time.

**Revisit when.** After the first pass of LMP analysis, decide
whether to keep all matching buses, restrict to EHV (transmission-
level), or pick a single representative pnode per substation.

## 2026-05-10 — Lock the 11-pnode target set (supersedes 2026-05-10 §4)

**Context.** Spike notebook (`notebooks/01_data_miner_spike.ipynb`)
resolved the actual pnode IDs and ran a one-day hourly LMP comparison
across 11 candidate pnodes. Two surprises forced a revision of the
prior "all matching buses" plan:

1. **Ashburn ≠ LOUDOUN.** The proposal's "Ashburn" substation has no
   500 KV transmission aggregate in PJM's registry. We initially
   proposed using LOUDOUN 500 KV as the proxy, on the theory that
   distribution-side LOAD pnodes typically track their upstream
   feeder. The 2026-04-15 spike disproved this: ASHBURN 35 KV LOAD
   showed *consistently higher* congestion than LOUDOUN 500 KV
   (mean $47 vs $28), and during a 15:00–17:00 window LOUDOUN went
   sharply negative (~−$35) while ASHBURN stayed slightly positive.
   The two signals are complementary, not redundant.

2. **Loudoun-area transmission pnodes cluster very tightly.**
   LOUDOUN, MOSBY, BRAMBLET, and SKFFSCRK all came back within
   ~$5/MWh mean LMP and ~$3/MWh mean congestion of each other.
   Useful for spatial-covariance work but largely interchangeable
   for the central regime-detection question.

**Decision.** Final pnode set (locked, n=11):

| Tier | pnode_id | pnode_name | type/subtype | voltage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primary nodal — transmission | 35010365 | LOUDOUN | AGGREGATE/EHV | 500 KV |
| Primary nodal — transmission | 35010371 | PLEASANT VIEW | AGGREGATE/EHV | 500 KV |
| Primary nodal — transmission | 1356178195 | GOOSECRE | AGGREGATE/EHV | 500 KV |
| Primary nodal — transmission | 1356178171 | BRAMBLET | AGGREGATE/EHV | 500 KV |
| Primary nodal — transmission | 1356178181 | MOSBY | AGGREGATE/EHV | 500 KV |
| Primary nodal — transmission | 1356178201 | SKFFSCRK | AGGREGATE/EHV | 500 KV |
| Primary nodal — distribution | 34886139 | ASHBURN 35 KV TX1 | BUS/LOAD | 35 KV |
| Primary nodal — distribution | 34886141 | ASHBURN 35 KV TX2 | BUS/LOAD | 35 KV |
| Control / outside-cluster | 35010369 | OX | AGGREGATE/EHV | 500 KV |
| Control / outside-cluster | 62871513 | BRISTERS | AGGREGATE/EHV | 500 KV |
| Zonal baseline | 34964545 | DOM | AGGREGATE/ZONE | n/a |

**Rationale.**
- Both ASHBURN 35 KV and LOUDOUN 500 KV stay in the *primary* set,
  not as proxy + sanity. The spike showed they capture different
  physics (distribution-level local load vs transmission-level
  import constraints) and should both be present in the regime
  analysis.
- The 6-pnode Loudoun-area transmission cluster gives spatial
  redundancy — useful for confirming whether a regime change is a
  cluster-wide phenomenon or a single-pnode artifact.
- OX and BRISTERS as control pnodes (same DOM zone, same voltage
  class, demonstrably *uncongested* on the spike day — OX mean
  congestion $0.86) enable a difference-in-differences treatment
  if needed: regime change at primary pnodes *while* controls stay
  flat is much stronger evidence than either signal alone.
- DOM zonal as baseline answers "how unusual is the nodal
  congestion vs the zone-wide signal everyone else looks at?"
- 11 pnodes × 288 5-min × 186 days = ~590K rows = ~12 paginated
  calls = ~2 min wall-time. Fits comfortably under the 6/min
  limit. (See `pjm-api-constraints.md` for sizing model.)

**Revisit when.**
- If the analysis proves stable, consider collapsing the
  Loudoun-area cluster (LOUDOUN/MOSBY/BRAMBLET/SKFFSCRK) into one
  representative pnode for narrative clarity.
- If ASHBURN TX1/TX2 prove indistinguishable in the bulk pull
  (max diff <$5/MWh consistently), drop one.
- If we need finer resolution on the data center driver, query
  the `gen` feed for Loudoun-area generator pnodes that may
  reflect data-center-adjacent generation response.

## 2026-05-11 — Acquisition module: sync httpx, filesystem-skip, hardcoded pnode constants

**Context.** Spike (`notebooks/01_data_miner_spike.ipynb`) validated the
end-to-end API shape. Before bulk pulls we needed a reusable, idempotent
acquisition layer that respects the 6/min rate limit, archive cutoffs,
366-day range cap, and PJM's quirks (envelope keys, pnode_name truncation).

**Decision.** Three architectural choices, all favoring the simpler option:

1. **Sync httpx (not async).** The 6/min rate limit makes us bound by
   wall time, not concurrency. A single API key cannot benefit from
   async multiplexing.
2. **Filesystem-based skip-if-exists** (not a SQLite ledger). Each
   chunk's parquet path is deterministic; presence on disk = pulled.
   `--force` overrides for re-pulls. `write_chunk` is atomic
   (`.tmp` + `os.replace`) so interrupted writes never pollute the
   skip-if-exists contract.
3. **Pnode IDs as a Python module constant** (`surg.acquisition.targets.PNODES`),
   not config. They are locked in this file (`decisions.md`) and treating
   them as code-level constants matches their stability.

**Rationale.** Each picks the simpler option in its trade-off, given a
single-developer research project with locked targets and a hard rate
ceiling that limits parallelism's value.

**Revisit when.** If we ever obtain a higher-rate API key, async
becomes worth it. If we add multi-target pulls (different pnode
sets per call), targets should move to config.
